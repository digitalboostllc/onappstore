# Prisma Configuration Changelog

## Current Configuration
- Using Prisma Client v6.3.1
- Supabase Postgres connection with pooling
- Retry mechanism for failed queries
- Prepared statement cleanup
- Error logging and monitoring
- Environment variable validation

## Latest Update (2024-02-07)
### Changes
- Updated to use Supabase-specific environment variables
- Using SUPABASE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL for production
- Using SUPABASE_POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING for development
- Added Supabase-specific error messages

### Previous Changes
- Added environment variable validation
- Added better error messages for missing env vars
- Centralized database URL configuration
- Added explicit environment checks
- Switched to pooled connections in production
- Added `DEALLOCATE ALL` before operations
- Reduced `MAX_RETRIES` from 2 to 1
- Reduced `RETRY_DELAY` from 50ms to 20ms
- Added better cleanup during retries
- Improved error logging format
- Lowered slow query threshold to 1000ms

### Issues Addressed
- Prepared statement conflicts (Error 42P05)
- Connection termination issues
- Slow query detection
- Connection pooling optimization

## Known Issues
1. Prepared Statement Conflicts
   - Error code: 42P05
   - Message: "prepared statement already exists"
   - Occurs during high concurrency
   - Current mitigation: DEALLOCATE ALL + retry mechanism

2. Connection Issues
   - Occasional connection termination
   - High-load scenario failures
   - Current mitigation: Retry mechanism + connection pooling

## Previous Updates

### Connection Pooling Implementation
- Added support for connection pooling
- Implemented retry mechanism
- Added cleanup handlers
- Enhanced error logging

### Error Handling Improvements
- Added production-specific error logging
- Implemented cleanup on process events
- Added slow query detection
- Added support for both named and default exports

## Future Plans

### Short Term
- Monitor effectiveness of current changes
- Gather metrics on query performance
- Analyze error patterns

### Medium Term
- Consider implementing pg-pool for better connection management
- Add metrics collection
- Implement circuit breaker pattern

### Long Term
- Evaluate connection pooling alternatives
- Consider implementing query caching
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement more sophisticated retry strategies

## Environment Variables
Required environment variables for proper operation:

```env
# Production (with connection pooling)
SUPABASE_POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=postgres://postgres.[ref]:[password]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require&supa=base-pooler.x

# Development (direct connection)
SUPABASE_POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=postgres://postgres.[ref]:[password]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```

## Troubleshooting Guide
1. Prepared Statement Errors (42P05)
   - Check connection pool settings
   - Verify DEALLOCATE ALL is working
   - Monitor concurrent connections

2. Connection Issues
   - Check connection pool limits
   - Verify environment variables
   - Monitor connection timeouts
