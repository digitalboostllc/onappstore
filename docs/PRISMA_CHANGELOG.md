# Prisma Configuration Changelog

## Current Configuration
- Using Prisma Client v6.3.1
- Connection pooling in production
- Retry mechanism for failed queries
- Prepared statement cleanup
- Error logging and monitoring
- Environment variable validation

## Latest Update (2024-02-07)
### Changes
- Added environment variable validation
- Added better error messages for missing env vars
- Centralized database URL configuration
- Added explicit environment checks

### Previous Changes
- Switched to pooled connections in production using `DATABASE_URL`
- Added `DEALLOCATE ALL` before operations to clean up prepared statements
- Reduced `MAX_RETRIES` from 2 to 1 for faster failure detection
- Reduced `RETRY_DELAY` from 50ms to 20ms
- Added better cleanup during retries
- Improved error logging format
- Lowered slow query threshold to 1000ms

### Issues Addressed
- Prepared statement conflicts (Error 42P05)
- Connection termination issues
- Slow query detection
- Connection pooling optimization

## Known Issues
1. Prepared Statement Conflicts
   - Error code: 42P05
   - Message: "prepared statement already exists"
   - Occurs during high concurrency
   - Current mitigation: DEALLOCATE ALL + retry mechanism

2. Connection Issues
   - Occasional connection termination
   - High-load scenario failures
   - Current mitigation: Retry mechanism + connection pooling

## Previous Updates

### Connection Pooling Implementation
- Added support for connection pooling
- Implemented retry mechanism
- Added cleanup handlers
- Enhanced error logging

### Error Handling Improvements
- Added production-specific error logging
- Implemented cleanup on process events
- Added slow query detection
- Added support for both named and default exports

## Future Plans

### Short Term
- Monitor effectiveness of current changes
- Gather metrics on query performance
- Analyze error patterns

### Medium Term
- Consider implementing pg-pool for better connection management
- Add metrics collection
- Implement circuit breaker pattern

### Long Term
- Evaluate connection pooling alternatives
- Consider implementing query caching
- Add performance monitoring
- Implement more sophisticated retry strategies

## Environment Variables
Required environment variables for proper operation:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:6543/db?pgbouncer=true
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/db
```

## Troubleshooting Guide
1. Prepared Statement Errors (42P05)
   - Check connection pool settings
   - Verify DEALLOCATE ALL is working
   - Monitor concurrent connections

2. Connection Issues
   - Check connection pool limits
   - Verify environment variables
   - Monitor connection timeouts
